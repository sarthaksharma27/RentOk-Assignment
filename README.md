A simplified web app where anyone can list their property, implements subdomain (multi-tenant) routing. Built with the Reactjs, Typescript etc, this application allows users to manage their property seamlessly. The goal is to create a dynamic and customizable web application where the appearance and content of the page change based on the subdomain accessed.

# Features

- **Color Scheme:** Each subdomain should have its own distinct color scheme.
- **Content:** Different subdomains may display different textual content on the page.
- **Images:** Customizable images associated with each subdomain.
- **Styles:** Basic styling such as fonts, margins, etc.


## Future plan

In the future, when there are many subdomains, I have added a form. The first step is user authentication 🔐. Once authenticated, if there is a paid plan for listing 💼 (subject to company policies), users can provide subdomain details and other necessary information. This information will be dynamically added to our system ⚙️.

Currently, this feature is in the development stage 🛠️. I haven't added this due to limited time availability ⏳.

# Installation


```bash
  npm install
  npm run dev
```
Visit http://localhost:5173 for the main domain.

For the subdomain, go to http://client1.localhost:5137

For the subdomain, go to http://client2.localhost:5137
